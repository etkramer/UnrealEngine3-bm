Short term:
 - Improve quality of fast compressors.
 - More accellerated compressors.
 - Accellerate mipmap generation.
 - Generic RGB pixel format conversion.
 - Do not assume that alpha is used for transparency.

Longer term:
 - support non power of two textures.
 - support for DXT1a format.
 - support for correct cubemap filtering.
 - support for correct cubemap borders and atlas borders. (Crytek request)
 - support for 3d textures & 3d compression.
 - Add support for occlusion map, horizon map & bent normal map generation.
 - Add support for accurate normal map mipmap computation. Using lighting integrals.
 - Add support for YCoCg and JPEG-LS color transforms. Add high quality DXT5-RGB compression.
 - Add full support for mirror wrap mode.
 - Generation of cone maps for relief mapping.
 - Add min/max box mipmap filters.
